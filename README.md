# Introduction


JdeRobot is a software development suite for robotics, home-automation and computer vision applications. These domains include sensors (for instance, cameras), actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming with such intelligent softwares. It is mainly written in C++ language and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the application program is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using Ice communication middleware. Components may be written in C++, python, Java... and all of them interoperate through explicit Ice interfaces.

JdeRobot simplifies the access to hardware devices from the control program. Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. They can be connected to real sensors and actuators or simulated ones, both locally or remotely using the network. Those functions build the API for the Hardware Abstraction Layer. The robotic application get the sensor readings and order the actuator commands using it to unfold its behavior. Several driver components have been developed to support different physical sensors, actuators and simulators. The drivers are used as components installed at will depending on your configuration. They are included in the official release. Currently supported robots and devices:

* RGBD sensors: Kinect from Microsoft, Asus Xtion
* Pioneer robot from MobileRobotics Inc.
* Kobuki robot (TurtleBot) from Yujin Robot
* Nao humanoid from Aldebaran
* ArDrone quadrotor from Parrot
* Firewire cameras, USB cameras, video files (mpeg, avi...), IP cameras (like Axis)
* Pantilt unit PTU-D46 from Directed Perception Inc.
* Laser Scanners: LMS from SICK and URG from Hokuyo
* EVI PTZ camera from Sony
* Gazebo and Stage simulators
* Wiimote
* X10 home automation devices

JdeRobot includes several robot programming tools and libraries. First, viewers and teleoperators for several robots, its sensors and motors. Second, a camara calibration component and a tunning tool for color filters. Third, VisualStates tool for programming robot behavior using hierarchical finite state machines. It includes many sample components using OpenCV, PCL, OpenGL, etc.. In addition, it also provides a library to develop fuzzy controllers, a library for projective geometry and some computer vision processing.

Each component may have its own independent Graphical User Interface or none at all. Currently, GTK and Qt libraries are supported, and several examples of OpenGL for 3D graphics with both libraries are included.

JdeRobot is open-source software, licensed as GPL and LGPL. It also uses third-party softwares like Gazebo simulator, OpenGL, GTK, Qt, Player, Stage, Gazebo, GSL, OpenCV, PCL, Eigen, Ogre.

JdeRobot is a project developed by Robotics Group of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain).

```

* Add the lastest Gazebo sources:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 67170598AF249743
```

sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://zeroc.com/download/Ice/3.7/ubuntu18.04 stable main"
```
* Add JdeRobot repository (using dedicated file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jderobot.list) For Ubuntu Xenial(16.04):

EOF'
```

* Get and add the public key from the JdeRobot repository

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 24E521A4
```

* Update the repositories
```
sudo apt update
```



<a name="deb"/>
### Installing from debian packages (RECOMMENDED)

* Install JdeRobot:

```
sudo apt install jderobot
sudo apt install jderobot-gazebo-assets
```

* After installing the package, you can close the terminal and reopen it to source the environment variables, OR just type: 

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
<a name="upd"/>

#### Updating packages

* If you already have a previous version of the packages installed, you only have to do:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```



<a name="dim"/>

### Installing from docker image

If you want to run JdeRobot in MS-Windows, MacOS or other Linux distributions you can use Docker containers. We have created a [Docker image](https://www.docker.com/) with current JdeRobot Release and all the necessary components to be used with [JdeRobot-Academy](http://jderobot.org/JdeRobot-Academy). To download it, use: 

```
docker pull jderobot/jderobot
```

For more information follow [this link](https://hub.docker.com/r/jderobot/jderobot/)  


<a name="manual"/>

### Manual installation

Downloading the source code from the GitHub is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED for new users unless you know what you are doing. 

<a name="deps"/>

#### Dependencies

You have two options here:
1. Install all the dependencies from a binary package
2. Install all the dependencies manually  (**NOT RECOMMENDED**)

For first one, you only have to type the following:

```
sudo apt install jderobot-deps-dev
```
and skip to the next section of this README.

For the second one... keep reading

JdeRobot has different external dependencies to build its structure. There are two types of dependencies: necessary dependencies and other dependencies. The firsts are needed to compile and install the basics of JdeRobot, that is, all its libraries and interfaces that are needed for the components or to develop components that use JdeRobot. The seconds are needed just for some components, but are not really necessary unless you want to use that components. For instance, the component gazeboserver uses Gazebo, a 3D robot simulator, so to use this component you may install Gazebo first.

First of all repeat the step [Getting environment ready](#env )
